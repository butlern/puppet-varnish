* Add additional system tests.
* Test out custom puppet.conf, see https://github.com/nanliu/rspec-puppet/commit/cbc3a77949d54df4267c4d8bbcf12d71fbecfa1f.
* Test out parser = future if above works out.
* Figure out how to handle parent directories of the storage files if the above does not.
* Test out inserting dependencies in system tests, e.g.
  class { 'varnish': }
  file { '/tmp/foo':
    require => Class[varnish::install]
    notity => Class[varnish::service]
